## 📦 Content Management

This template uses **Astro Content Collections**, allowing you to update content by editing JSON/Markdown files without touching the code.

### 👤 1. Profile Information
Edit file: `src/content/profile/me.json`
```json
{
  "name": "Your Name",
  "bio": "A short bio about yourself",
  "avatar": "../../assets/avatar.png",
  "location": "City, Country",
  "verified": true,
  "phone": "+1234567890", // Optional: for VCard/Save Contact
  "email": "hello@example.com" // Optional: for VCard/Save Contact
}
```
*Note: Place your profile picture in the `src/assets/` directory.*

### 📥 2. Save Contact (VCard)
The "Save Contact" button on the home page allows users to download your contact information directly to their phone.
To configure the information included in the VCard (.vcf file), add the `phone` and `email` fields to your `src/content/profile/me.json` as shown above.

### 🔗 3. Links (Bento Grid)
Each link is a `.json` file in the `src/content/links/` directory. You can create multiple files like `facebook.json`, `portfolio.json`, `bank.json`.

**Link File Structure:**
```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "title": "Display Title",
  "url": "https://your-link.com",
  "icon": "LucideIconName", // Icon name from Lucide (e.g., Youtube, Github, Mail)
  "isFeatured": true, // Displays a 'Featured' badge
  "layout": "large", // 'large', 'medium', or 'small'
  "color": "#FF0000" // Accent color for the card
}
```

**Layout Types:**
- `large`: Occupies 2 columns and 2 rows (Best for featured products or videos).
- `medium`: Occupies 2 columns and 1 row (Best for primary links).
- `small`: Occupies 1 column (Best for social icons or small stats).

**Copy to Clipboard Feature:**
To enable fast copy, set the URL to: `#copy:content-to-copy`
*Example: `#copy:0123456789`*

### 📱 4. Social Media
Edit/Create files in: `src/content/socials/`
These will always render as `small` cards at the end of the grid.

---

## 🎨 Customization

- **Icons:** The template uses [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/icons). Just use the icon name in the `icon` field within the JSON files.
- **Background:** You can customize the Mesh Gradient colors in `src/layouts/Layout.astro`.
- **CSS:** Custom Tailwind effects are located in `src/styles/global.css`.
